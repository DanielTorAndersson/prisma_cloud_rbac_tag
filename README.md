# Prisma Cloud RBAC Automation Script

## Overview

This script automates the setup of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations in Prisma Cloud, specifically tailored for Microsoft Azure subscriptions. The script leverages the Prisma Cloud API to perform the following tasks:

1. **Fetch Azure Subscription Information:**
   - Query Prisma Cloud to retrieve Azure subscription data using a predefined search query. The predefined query will look at subscription level if there are any tags that matches the key "__AUTO_TEST", and will use the value for the RBAC configuration.
   - Extract relevant information such as subscription IDs and associated tags.

2. **Create Account Groups:**
   - Check the existence of account groups for each Azure subscription.
   - If an account group doesn't exist, create a new one with a specific naming convention.

3. **Update User Roles:**
   - Check for the existence of user roles based on predefined tags.
   - If a user role exists, update it with the corresponding account group IDs.
   - If a user role doesn't exist, create a new one with the associated account group.
