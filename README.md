# Prisma Cloud RBAC Automation Script

## Overview

This script automates the setup of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations in Prisma Cloud, specifically tailored for Microsoft Azure subscriptions. The script leverages the Prisma Cloud API to perform the following tasks:

1. **Fetch Azure Subscription Information:**
   - Query Prisma Cloud to retrieve Azure subscription data using a predefined search query. The predefined query will look at subscription level if there are any tags that matches the key defined as "__AUTO_TEST". The script will use the Value of the same key/value pair for the RBAC configuration in this script.
   - Extract relevant information such as subscription IDs and associated tags.

   Note: "__AUTO_TEST" tag value can be replaced to match a key/value pair in Azure subscriptions.

   The RQL query are defined on line #32, and it can be modified to match a smaller scope. Like a specific subscription rather than all.
   Use "investigate" tab in Prisma to find a good scope to test if needed.

2. **Create Account Groups:**
   - Check the existence of account groups for each Azure subscription.
   - If an account group doesn't exist, create a new one with a specific naming convention.
   - The account group will be named with the subscription ID of which is matches for tracing perspective.

3. **Update User Roles:**
   - Check for the existence of user roles based on predefined tags.
   - If a user role exists, update it with the corresponding account group IDs.
   - If a user role doesn't exist, create a new one with the associated account group.
   - The granular user roles will be named after the users, so they can be reused if a email a found in more than one place.
